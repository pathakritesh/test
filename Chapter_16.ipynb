    "[A] State whether the following statements are True or False: \n",
    "(a) If a file is opened for reading, it is necessary that the file must exist.\n",
    "Ans: True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) If a file opened for writing already exists, its contents would be overwritten. \n",
    "Ans: True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) For opening a file in append mode it is necessary that the file should exist. \n",
    "Ans:True\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) On opening a file for reading which of the following activities are performed: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The disk is searched for existence of the file. \n",
    "2. The file is brought into memory. \n",
    "3. A pointer is set up which points to the first character in the file. \n",
    "4. All the above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Is it necessary that a file created in text mode must always be opened in text mode for subsequent operations? \n",
    "Ans: True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) While using the statement, fp = open('myfile.', 'r') what happens if, - 'myfile' does not exist on the disk \n",
    "- 'myfile' exists on the disk\n",
    "Ans: error\n",
    "\n",

    "(d) While using the statement, f = open('myfile', 'wb') what happens if, - 'myfile' does not exist on the disk \n",
    "- 'myfile' exists on the disk \n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) A floating-point array contains percentage marks obtained by students in an examination. \n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[B] Attempt the following: \n",
    "(a) Write a program to read a file and display its contents along with line numbers before each line. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Write a program to append the contents of one file at the end of another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Suppose a file contains student's records with each record containing name and age of a student. \n",
    "Write a program to read these records and display them in sorted order by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Write a program to copy contents of one file to another. While doing so replace all lowercase characters to their \n",
    "equivalent uppercase characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Write a program that merges lines alternately from two files and writes the results to new file. \n",
    "If one file has less number of lines than the other, the remaining lines from the larger file should be simply copied \n",
    "into the target file. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Write a program to encrypt/decrypt a file using: \n",
    "(1) Offset cipher: In this cipher each character from the source file is offset with a fixed value and then written to the \n",
    "target file.For example, if character read from the source file is 'A', then write a character represented by 'A' + 128 to \n",
    "the target file. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Substitution cipher: In this cipher each for character read from the source file a corresponding predetermined character \n",
    "is written to the target file. For example, if character 'A' is read from the source file, then a '!' would be\n",
    "written to the target file. Similarly, every 'B' would be substituted by '5' and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Suppose an Employee object contains following details: employee codeemployee namedate of joiningsalary \n",
    "Write a program to serialize and deserialize this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) A hospital keeps a file of blood donors in which each record has the format: Name: 20 ColumnsAddress: 40 \n",
    "ColumnsAge: 2 ColumnsBlood Type: 1 Column (Type 1, 2, 3 or 4)Write a program to read the file and print a list of all blood \n",
    "donors whose age is below 25 and whose blood type is 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Given a list of names of students in a class, write a program to store the names in a file on disk. Make a provision \n",
    "to display the nth name in the list, where n is read from the keyboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(j) Assume that a Master file contains two fields, roll number and name of the student. At the end of the year, \n",
    "a set of students join the class and another set leaves. A Transaction file contains the roll numbers and an \n",
    "appropriate code to add or delete a student. Write a program to create another file that contains the \n",
    "updated list of names and roll numbers. Assume that the Master file and the Transaction file are \n",
    "arranged in ascending order by roll numbers. The updated file should also be in ascending order by roll numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
