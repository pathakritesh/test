    "[A] State whether the following statements are True or False: \n",
    "(a) The exception handling mechanism is supposed to handle compile time errors. \n",

    "(f) Write a program that receives 10 integers and stores them and their cubes in a dictionary. \n",
    "If the number entered is less than 3, raise a user-defined exception NumberTooSmall, and if the number entered is more than 30, \n",
